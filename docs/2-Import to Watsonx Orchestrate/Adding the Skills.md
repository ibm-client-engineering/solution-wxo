Add the skills from the skill catalog, and connect the application:

2. Find "JC - ServiceNow API" from the list
3. Connect the app
  1. Click the "Connect the app" box on the top right
  2. Enter the username and password of the ServiceNow account with access to the REST API
  3. Click connect app
4. Add each imported skill from the list

The skills should now be added to your catalog under "JC - Watsonx Orchestrate ServiceNow API" and ready for use directly or in a composite Skill flow.

:::tip
Be sure to add all the skills you need! You will not be able to make a [Composite Skill](compositeskills#composite-skills) without adding the necessary skills first.

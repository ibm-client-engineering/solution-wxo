# Walkthrough of the JC - Watsonx Orchestrate ServiceNow API yaml

## Basic Structure

### Metadata
Watsonx orchestrate requires `x-ibm-application` headers for properly importing skills from yaml files. Refer to the Watsonx Orchestrate documentation [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watson-orchestrate?topic=files-using-x-properties)

`x-ibm-application-icon:` object is my SVG image (produces a orange/black JC)

```yaml
externalDocs:
  url: https://docs.servicenow.com/?context=CSHelp:REST-Table-API
```
### Servers
This URL needs to be set <strong>for the instance you are planning on using</strong>. This is an example instance with its own username/password combination for the REST API user. When you create your own instance, update the URL here.
```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://dev213519.service-now.com/
```

### Security

This script usses basic authentication (username/password) combination. 

```yaml
security:
  - basicAuth: []
```
and under components:
```yaml           
securitySchemes:
  basicAuth:
    type: http
    scheme: basic
```
:::note
The out-of-the-box Watsonx Orchestrate ServiceNow skills uses OAUTH authentication, which requires supplying the Server name, `client_id` and `client_secret` in addition to a username and password. It is also possible to configure this application this way by using a OAUTH provider and OAUTH credentials from ServiceNow.
:::
## Paths
The paths define the path of the API call. For this walkthrough, we'll use the path that allows us to modify Tasks. The name of the Tasks table in ServiceNow is "sc_tasks", defined as the `tableName` parameter in the script, and hardcoded in the path below.

```yaml
paths:  
  /api/now/table/sc_task?sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_exclude_reference_link=true:
```
:::note
The querys used in this script `sysparm_display_value=true` and `sysparm_exclude_reference_link=true` are in the path. Most swagger validators will not allow this, however Watsonx Orchestrate allows query parameters in the path. These are used to recieve friendly values in our response from ServiceNow.
:::

### API Calls
Each skill on Watsonx Orchestrate is done by defining an API call. Here's a great resource to [help with the API commands for ServiceNow](https://docs.servicenow.com/?context=CSHelp:REST-Table-API)

 It is reccomended that you create a specific "get" call per skill (eg: Retrieve all TASKS from Servicenow). Having the user specify the `tableName` is not a friendly display. In the code below, 2 skills are identified: 
1. <strong>get</strong> API call: JC - Retrieve all Tasks from ServiceNow
2. <strong>post</strong> API call:

```yaml
get:
  summary: JC - Retrieve all Tasks from ServiceNow
  description: Retrieve all Tasks from ServiceNow
  operationId: retrieveTasks
  responses:
    '200':
      description: Results
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/getTable'
post:
  summary: JC - Create a new Task in ServiceNow
  description: Create a new Task in ServiceNow
  operationId: createTask
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json: 
        schema:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/editTable'
```
`objectId` object gives the task a unuqie name for the backend to point to this skill

`description` objext is the description Watsonx Orchestrate applies to the skill

`summary` object is the name Watsonx Orchestrate applies to the skill

:::warning
A `operationId` and `summary` object is required for each skill in order to pass Watsonx Orchestrate's validation process for all imported skill files.
:::

### Request Body
Request bodies define the content to be sent to Servicenow

```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/editTable'     
```
The editTable schema defines the properties of the request body when creating a new task via the "JC - Create a Task in ServiceNow" skill. This is to be edited if a different <strong>input</strong> on Watsonx Orchestrate is desired.
```yaml
editTable:
  type: object
  properties:
    short_description:
      x-ibm-label: Short Description
      type: string
      description: 'Short description of the record'
    description:
      x-ibm-label: Description
      x-ibm-multiline: true
      type: string
      description: 'Detailed description of the record'
    urgency:
      x-ibm-label: Urgency
      type: integer
      description: '3 - Low, 2 - Medium, 1 - High'
      enum:
        - 3
        - 2
        - 1
```
### Responses
The responses from ServiceNow reference a schema to get only the specific information. This is to be edited if a different <strong>output</strong> on Watsonx Orchestrate is desired. See [Sample Outputs](outputs) for more.

```yaml
responses:
  '201':
    description: Task created
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/getthisTable'
```
#### Response Schema
See [Sample Outputs](outputs) for other example output schemas used.

```yaml
getthisTable:
#Use when getting a single table such as Tasks and Incidents from a composite (sysID required input) skill
  type: object
  properties:
    result:
      x-ibm-label: Results
      type: object
      properties:
          sys_id:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/sysID'
          opened_at:
            type: string
          assignment_group:
            type: string
          assigned_to:
            type: string
          urgency:
            type: string
          opened_by:
            type: string
          state:
            type: string
          description:
            type: string
          short_description:
            type: string
          number:
            type: string
```

## Composite Skills
These skills need to be composite because a `sysID` parameter is required in the path (see `{sys_ID}`). The `sysId` is the unique ServiceNow identifier to a specific table item. To get this identifier, we use a [Top Level Skill](/servicenow/GettingStarted/skills#top-level-skills) first in the skill flow. Next we add the [Composite Skill](/servicenow/GettingStarted/skills#composite-skills). When the user selects a task from the table, the `sysID` is captured as an output, then used as an input for the composite skill. This way, the user never has to worry about finding the ServiceNow `sysID`. 

Below are two composite Skills:

```yaml
/api/now/table/sc_task/{sys_id}?sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_exclude_reference_link=true:
  get:
    summary: JC - Retrieve a specific Task in ServiceNow (Composite only)
    description: Composite Skill - Retrieve a Task record in ServiceNow
    operationId: retrievethisTask
    parameters:
      - name: sys_id
        x-ibm-label: ServiceNow SysID (hidden)
        in: path
        required: true
        schema:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/sysID'
    responses:
      '200':
        description: ok
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/getthisTable'    
  put:
    summary: JC - Modify a specific Task in ServiceNow (Composite only)
    description: Composite Skill - Modify a specific Task in ServiceNow
    operationId: modifythisTask
    parameters:
      - name: sys_id
        x-ibm-label: ServiceNow SysID (hidden)
        in: path
        required: true
        schema:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/sysID'
    requestBody:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/editTable'          
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Record updated
        content:
          application/json: 
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/getthisTable'
```

## Schcema Components
In the components sections there are required schemas to apply properties or define the output of the response from ServiceNow
#### sysID
```yaml
sysID: #sysID is a required output for composite skills, not shown to user in table
  x-ibm-show: false
  type: string
```
`x-ibm-show: false` hides this parameter from the user. It is required so it can be part of the skill output to be used as a composite skill's input.
### Output Schemas
#### getthisTable
Output schema for a single table output such as a single Task or Incident
```yaml
getthisTable: #Use when getting a single table such as Tasks and Incidents from a composite (sysID required input) skill
  type: object
  properties:
    result:
      x-ibm-label: Results
      type: object
      properties:
          sys_id:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/sysID'
          opened_at:
            type: string
          assignment_group:
            type: string
          assigned_to:
            type: string
          urgency:
            type: string
          opened_by:
            type: string
          state:
            type: string
          description:
            type: string
          short_description:
            type: string
          number:
            type: string
```
`x-ibm-label:` is used to name the skill output "Results"
:::note
Note that the `sys_id` object is pointing to the `sysID` schema. This is where the ServiceNow sysID is an output item of the skill, but never shown to the user.
:::
#### getsingleKB
Output schema for a single table output for a KB
:::note
There is little difference in the output between an Incident table and a Task table so they use the same schema. KB's are different tables entirely and require their own outpit schema
:::
```yaml
getsingleKB:
      type: object
      properties:
        result:
          x-ibm-label: Results
          type: object
          properties:
              sys_id:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/sysID'
              last_updated_on:
                type: string
              content:
                type: string
              author:
                type: string
              short_description:

                type: string
```
#### getKBs
Output schema for a table of KBs
```yaml
getKBs:
      type: object
      properties:
        result:

          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              sys_id:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/sysID'
              last_updated_on:
                type: string
              content:
                type: string
              author:
                type: string
              short_description:
                type: string
              number:
                type: string
```
#### getTable
Output schema for a table of Tasks or incidents
```yaml
getTable:     #Use for multiple table results (skills like Get all Tasks and Get all Incidents)

            type: object
            properties:
              sys_id:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/sysID'
              opened_at:
                type: string
              assignment_group:

#### editTable
Schema to define the content when editing a Task or Incident
```yaml
editKB:

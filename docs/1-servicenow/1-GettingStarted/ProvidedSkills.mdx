### Composite Skills

:::info
All skills denoted by "Composite Skill - " and labeled with "(Composite Skill)" are only for use in a Watsonx Orchestrate Skill Flow directly after one of the above "Top Level Skills". These skills will <strong>not work</strong> as a first step or by direct usage in Watsonx Orchestrate. This is because the ServiceNow sysID is a required parameter which is a hidden input. See [Creating Composite Skills](/servicenow/ImporttoWXO/compositeskills#composite-skills).

### Incomplete Skills

<details>
<summary>Non-Functional or Incomplete Skills</summary>

These are skills that you can see commented out in the script either unused or under construction.

##### Skills Under Construction

Create a new KB in ServiceNow (input schema needed for creating a KB)

##### Skills that require the non-friendly input parameter for tableName

:::info
To request table data from ServiceNow, the tableName (incidents, tasks or KBs) must be an input parameter. To do so the user would have to input the exact table name (e.g. for Tasks the user would need to input "sc_task" as the tableName) so these skills have been removed. These are to be used as reference and the path is to be used to specify the tableName needed.

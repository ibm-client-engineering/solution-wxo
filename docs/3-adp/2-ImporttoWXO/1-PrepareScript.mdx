### Download and prepare the yaml
#### Steps
1. Download the latest .yaml file <a href="https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-wxo/blob/main/assets/watsonxai/scripts/JC%20-%20Watsonx%20Orchestrate%20Watsonx%20API.yml">here</a>
2. Open the script and replace the Server and Watsonx Project ID:

`server`

```yaml
servers:
  - url: "https://YourWatsonxServer.cloud.ibm.com"
  #Put your Watsonx Server URL between the quotes
```
`project_id`

```yaml
properties:
  project_id:
    x-ibm-disable: true
    x-ibm-show: false
    type: string
    #Update the default value to your project's Project ID
    default: "<your project ID>"
    #Put your project ID between the quotes
```

:::tip
To find your project ID in Watsonx, select to your project, click "Manage", and should be listed under "General" > "Details" > "Project ID"
:::

3. Upload the script to your Watsonx Orchestrate instance
    1. Click the hamburger menu icon at the top left of the page, then click "Skills"
    2. Click "Add skills" at the top right of the page
    3. Click the "From files" tab
    4. Click the upload box and select the yaml file
    5. Click next

4. Select the skills you need from the API (see <a href="/solution-wxo/watsonx/GettingStarted/skills">Provided Skills</a>)
5. Click add on the bottom right

Each skill should now be available in your list of skills and are ready to be staged.

:::warning
Double check the version level in the path to ensure it matches your Watsonx version - See https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/machine-learning#versioning 

If they do not match you may have to update the path query to the available version.
```yaml
paths:
  "/ml/v1-beta/generation/text?version=2023-05-29":
```
